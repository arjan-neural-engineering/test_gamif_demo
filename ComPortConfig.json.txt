Example ComPortConfig.json
===================================================
A file based on the JSON template below should be saved at
climber/config_local/ComPortConfig.json

Comments are (unfortunately) not allowed in JSON files

This file should contain com port numbers (e.g. "COM3") used to connect to
various devices (usually via USB). For example "StimWatchdogCOM" is the COM Port
the StimPC needs to connect to the Stim Watchdog Arduino (in the stim e-stop
box).

The fields defined here can be referenced in the Loader appman.conf files or in modules.

Variables can be added or removed as necessary and are accessible via the
loadLocalComPortConfig.m and loadLocalConfigs.m functions
